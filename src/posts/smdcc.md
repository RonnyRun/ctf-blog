## owo what's this

hi, this is an [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums) themed blog that i made for my friend [ronnyrun](https://github.com/ronnyrun)

## nerd!

it's made using [sveltekit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) and uses markdown files as blog posts.
the site is completely static, markdown filkes are rendered at build time using [mdsvex](https://mdsvex.com/).

it supports code syntax highlighting using [prismjs](https://prismjs.com/), like so:

```javascript
const a = 'test';
function test() {
	console.log(a);
}
```

source code is [available on github](https://github.com/ssebastianoo/osu-blog)
